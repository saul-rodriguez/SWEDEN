SWEDEN

The custom scenery is available through github at https://github.com/saul-rodriguez/SWEDEN . Use a git client or directly the "download" button on the web interface. In a linux terminal it would look like this:

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/saul-rodriguez/SWEDEN

You will need to add the path to the downloaded/cloned directory to fg_scenery so that the objects appear during simulation. Also, there is a small number of settings that need to be modified. Follow the instructions here:
